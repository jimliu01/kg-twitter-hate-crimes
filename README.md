## Introduction

In the wake of escalating racial tensions and surges in xenophobia in the aftermath of COVID-19, hate crimes directed toward marginalized communities have emerged as a poignant issue within the United States [1]. Meanwhile, online social media has become a hotbed of discourse around LGBTQIA+ issues, religious debates, and racial topics, which escalated in intensity and frequency following major societal events such as George Floydâ€™s death and the outbreak of the pandemic [2]. Our study investigates the subtle, yet important, relationships between online discourse and hate crimes.

## Research Objectives

Our research aims to use comprehensive data-driven and network methods to investigate whether there exists a correlation between the characteristics of online discourse (such as sentiment and topic of the comments) and the frequency and nature of hate crimes.
