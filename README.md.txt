## Introduction

In the wake of escalating racial tensions and surges in xenophobia in the aftermath of COVID-19, hate crimes directed toward marginalized communities have emerged as a poignant issue within the United States [1]. Meanwhile, online social media has become a hotbed of discourse around LGBTQIA+ issues, religious debates, and racial topics, which escalated in intensity and frequency following major societal events such as George Floyd’s death and the outbreak of the pandemic [2]. Our study investigates the subtle, yet important, relationships between online discourse and hate crimes.

## Research Objectives

Our research aims to use comprehensive data-driven and network methods to investigate whether there exists a correlation between the characteristics of online discourse (such as sentiment and topic of the comments) and the frequency and nature of hate crimes.

## Background

Prior research has examined the complex interplay between online discourse and offline actions [3] [4]. Recent works have found correlations between online comments and offline hate crimes [5, 6, 7]. Qualitative interviews have also shown direct individual-level links between online abuse and offline hate crimes with significant consequences [9].

## Data Sources

Our investigation is built upon two primary sources of data:

1. **Tweets:** A representative sample of online discourse.
2. **FBI Crime Data:** Comprehensive hate crime data drawn from the FBI Crime Data Explorer.

We limit our analysis to the state of California, focusing on the five most targeted minority groups during March to December 2020.

## Methodology

We employ statistical analysis methods such as linear regression, Granger causality test, and Pearson and Spearman’s correlation coefficients. Our work also includes graph-based analysis using Knowledge Graphs (KGs), a robust methodology for structuring and analyzing large text data [10].

## Findings

Our findings suggest correlations between intense tweets, political events, and hate crimes. Key contributions include:

1. Compilation of a dataset focusing on tweets discussing racial and identity-related discourses.
2. In-depth statistical analysis highlighting the relationship between Twitter discourses and hate crimes.
3. Utilization of a Knowledge Graph to map out connections between individual tweets and the hate crime dataset.

## Paper Structure

- **Section II:** Identifying marginalized-group-related keywords and filtering tweets.
- **Section III:** Performing sentiment analysis and topic modeling on filtered tweets.
- **Section IV:** Time series analysis to investigate the correlation between online discourse and hate crimes.
- **Section V:** Creating a knowledge graph that combines the Twitter dataset and the hate crimes.
- **Section VI:** Conducting graph analysis such as dynamic community detection and centrality analysis.
